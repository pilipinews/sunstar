DIGITIZE LAND TITLES, DABAWENYOS URGED

THE Land Registration Authority (LRA) encouraged the public to digitize their land titles for security reasons during the Kapehan sa Davao at SM City, Ecoland, on Monday, September 10, 2018.

During the event, Virgilio Delos Reyes, Land Registration Examineer 2, said electronic titles (e-titles) are designed to secure land titles since these will be encoded in the database.

"Manawagan mi sa publiko na feel free to visit to verify your titles aron mahibal-an nato unsay status sa inyong titulo (We are asking the public to please feel free to visit [the office] to verify your titles so that we will know its status)," Delos Reyes said.

"Kani ang pamaagi na ma-ensure nato ang mga titulo are accessible, then electronically preserved and backed-up securely for future references (This is a way to ensure the land titles are accessible, then electronically preserved and backed-up securely for future references)," Amella Respicio-Samarita, ROD Records Officer 2, said.

The certified true copy of land title, however, is still required to process e-titles.

Delos Reyes said that in digitizing the land titles, corruption will be lessened because "in one click of a finger, you may view your title status and every process is documented."

"We really encourage ang mga katawhan nga since digitalize naman ang atong system na gina-adapt, no more need na muagi pamo ug mga tao kay all you have to do is to entry, pay or visit our office to ask," Respicio-Samarita said.

Delos Reyes said they do not tolerate corruption in the office as LRA is one of the top income-generating offices of the government and the public should also stop paying employees for personal requests.

The database, however, is regionalized but the public may request records if their land is located in different region.
