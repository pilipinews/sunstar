TRAFFIC LAWS, PUBLIC SAFETY IN CURRICULUM

TOPICS on traffic regulations and public safety will be included in primary and secondary schools' curriculum in Davao City.

During the Pulong-Pulong ni Pulong at the City Council on Tuesday, September 11, Davao City Councilor Maria Belen Acosta said by including the topics in the curriculum, students will be taught properly at an early age.

"Kaning traffic regulations man gud basic kaayo ni siya pero dili ginasunod sa mga tao. So if you notice, daghan kaayo ug mga aksidente (These traffic regulations are basic laws we have to follow but often violated by the people)," Acosta said.

Meanwhile, Acosta said since the city has an ordinance different from the national, it was decided to contextualize the curriculum according to the laws in the city.

"The regional director of DepEd said that it is a good thing that the curriculum is contextualized for the residents of Davao City," she said.

Teachers will be trained to teach the students but Acosta said the school could also invite resource persons from the Davao City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office, Bureau of Fire Protection, and City Transport and Traffic Management Office, among others.

"We aim to protect our children through teaching them basic safety measures and survival tips," Acosta said.

A three-day seminar and workshop was conducted by the Department of Education last August 23-25 to formulate the contents of the Safety Modules with resource speakers from Davao City Police Office, Land Transportation Office-Davao, and Public Safety and Security Command Center-Central 911.
