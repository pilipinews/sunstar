6 NABBED WITH 35 KILOS OF MARIJUANA LEAVES

SIX persons were arrested on Monday evening in an apartment in Cubao, Quezon City where anti-narcotics agents recovered at least 35 kilos of dried marijuana leaves, a police official said Tuesday, September 11.

Quezon City Police District (QCPD) police director Chief Superintendent Joselito Esquivel identified the arrested suspects as Grenie Hierro, 34; Lassery Ann Rayo, 30; Anthony John Timpug, 39; Archie Visperas, 22 and Randbel Clifford Venzon, 20 while a 16-year-old male was "rescued."

He said at about 8:00 p.m. on September 10, police from the Drug Enforcement Unit of Police Station 7 in Cubao together with operatives of Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) National Capital Region conducted a drug bust at Room No. 25, Mary Grace Haven Apartment, Denver Street in Barangay Immaculate Concepcion that led to the arrest of the suspects.

Esquivel said the operation stemmed from a report from a concerned citizen through the Mobile Text Hotline i-Send Mo sa Team NCRPO about the illegal drug activities of the suspects which prompted them to conduct a surveillance operation.

Operatives seized from the suspects several bricks of marijuana leaves and fruiting tops in plastic wraps weighing about 35 kilos with an estimated street value of P4.6 million, seven cellular phones and various drug paraphernalia.

The suspects said that the illegal drugs came from the provinces of Kalinga and Apayao, said Esquivel.

The suspects will be charged for violation of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 or illegal possession of illegal drugs. (SUNSTAR PHILIPPINES)
