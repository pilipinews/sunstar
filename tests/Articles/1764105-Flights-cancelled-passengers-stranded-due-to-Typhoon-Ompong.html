The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) said Ompong has slightly slowed down while moving westward.

Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal Number 1 has been hoisted over Batanes, Cagayan including Babuyan group of Islands, Apayao, Abra, Kalinga, Mountain Province, Ifugao, Isabela, Benguet, Quirino, Nueva Vizcaya, Aurora, Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Rizal, Laguna, Quezon inc.

Pagasa said Ompong is expected to badly hit the provinces in extreme northern Luzon.

He said 30 passengers were stranded in San Pascual, Masbate; 18 in Pasacao, Camarines Sur; 116 in Tabaco City, Albay; 45 in Bulan, Sorsogon; and 298 in Matnog, Sorsogon.
