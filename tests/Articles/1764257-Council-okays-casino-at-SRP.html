COUNCIL OKAYS CASINO AT SRP

IN A nine-eight vote, the Cebu City Council junked the resolution that would have supported the pronouncement of President Rodrigo Duterte to prohibit the construction of new casinos in the country.

The resolution was authored by Councilor Raymond Garcia, a member of the opposition.

During the council's deliberation last Tuesday, Councilor Margarita Osmeña said she could not approve the measure because she earlier supported the plan to establish a casino at the South Road Properties (SRP).

"I want to be consistent with my stand," she said.

Because of the objection, Vice Mayor Edgardo Labella, who presides over the council, called for a vote.

Nine administration councilors, including Councilor Osmeña, voted against it, while the eight opposition councilors voted for its approval.

The Universal Hotels and Resorts Inc. (UHRI) is set to develop an P18-billion integrated hotel and casino on Kawit Island after it signed a joint-venture deal with the City Government last Aug. 17.

The opposition, through a case filed in court, had questioned the legality of the deal.

Its members said the City would violate the President's directive if the construction of the casino would proceed.

Last Aug. 8, Duterte said the government would stop issuing licenses for new casinos after the controversial deal with the Nayong Pilipino Foundation. RVC
