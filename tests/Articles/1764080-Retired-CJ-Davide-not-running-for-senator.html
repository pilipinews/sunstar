RETIRED CJ DAVIDE 'NOT RUNNING FOR SENATOR'

CEBU Gov. Hilario Davide III believes his father, retired Chief Justice Hilario Davide Jr., will not pursue any political plans in next year's elections. There were reports that the Liberal Party (LP) is courting the 82-year-old former chief justice to be part of its senatorial lineup in 2019. But for Gov. Davide, he said his father might decline because of his age and his long stint as a government official. Aside from being the Supreme Court chief justice from 1998 to 2005, the older Davide also worked as permanent representative of the Philippines to the United Nations from 2007 to 2010. "My father has no appetite for politics," the younger Davide said. Gov. Davide also said that he and his family would probably oppose plans for the former chief justice to run for senator. "We would advice against it. There is only one politician in the family and that's me," Gov. Davide added. The former chief justice was one of 18 candidates LP plans to field for senate in next year's elections. The list includes reelectionist Sen. Paolo Benigno "Bam" Aquino IV, former senator and presidential aspirant Manuel "Mar" Roxas II, actress Agot Isidro and singer Jim Paredes. (JKV)
