DUTERTE TO PRESENT PROOF OF OUSTER PLOT

PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday, September 11, said he would make public the evidence that would prove the supposed connivance of the communists and the opposition, including Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, in trying to oust him.

In a one-on-one talk with Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo, Duterte said he has already requested that the documents about the alleged ouster plot against him be declassified.

He insisted that there was a "loose conspiracy" among the opposition, Liberal Party, communist group, and Magdalo group led by Trillanes to oust him by October.

"Si Sison pati itong Magdalo, pati itong mga ayaw sa akin, 'yung talagang hindi tumanggap sa akin (Sison, Magdalo, and other opposition who cannot accept me) ever since the election, they have combined and we have evidence. And we have the conversation provided by a foreign country sympathetic to us," he said.

"The connection will be shown maybe any day now. I asked that it be declassified at ipakita nila lahat (and show them everything)," Duterte added.

On Monday, September 10, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana confirmed that there was an ouster plot by the Communist Party of the Philippines led by founder Jose Maria Sison, but said they have not verified reports of the communists' connivance with Trillanes and the Liberal Party (LP).

The LP on Sunday, September 9, denied that it was conniving with Trillanes and the communists to remove Duterte from office. The opposition party also branded Duterte's claim as baseless, stressing that it remains truthful to the 1987 Constitution.

Also on Sunday, Trillanes denied Duterte's allegation, saying the Chief Executive was merely being "paranoid."

The President, however, maintained that the three parties are in "constant communication" to successfully remove him from office.

"They were in constant communication. They are. It might be a loose conspiracy but they are into it," he said.

"Basta iyang yellow (LP) iyan may grupo diyan na nakadikit kay Sison at si Trillanes, may personal contact. Alam na ng military iyan," Duterte added.

(The yellows [LP] have partymates who are close to Sison and Trillanes. They have personal contact with them. The military knows that.) (SUNSTAR PHILIPPINES)
