FLI, BUS COMPANY TO BUILD MORE MYBUS STOPS IN SRP

Filinvest Land Inc. (FLI) has entered a partnership with Metro Rapid Transit Service Inc. to have MyBus stops within the City di Mare development in the South Road Properties (SRP).

The public bus transport will complement the existing development of FLI in the SRP, which is expected to draw more investors in its commercial areas and tenants, and residents in its residential developments.

MyBus stops inside the City di Mare development are available in its two residential areas, including Sanremo Oasis and Amalfi, the University of the Philippines Professional School and in Il Corso, the only al fresco waterfront mall in Cebu.

The MyBus service has been available for City di Mare residents, locators, tenants and visitors since September 1.

Bus trip from City di Mare to SM City Cebu will start at 6:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. and an interval of two hours thereafter every day.

From SM City Cebu, bus routes for Mandaue City, particularly in Parkmall and to Mactan-Cebu International Airport, are also available.

From SM City Cebu, bus trips to City di Mare will start from 6:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. and and every two hours thereafter every day.

Bus trips from City di Mare to Talisay City and vice versa are also available starting from 10 a.m.

Aside from its residential buildings, Dolly Macan, Filinvest City and City di Mare senior project development manager, said that the City di Mare development that sits on a 50-hectare lot in the SRP will also have office spaces and institutional and mixed-use areas, making it a lifestyle capital of Cebu.

Of the 50-hectare, 40 hectares are dedicated to the joint venture project with the Cebu City Government that was agreed in 2009.

As of the moment, FLI Marketing Manager Kat Mercado said portions of their two mid-rise residential buildings, Sanremo Oasis and Amalfi, are already sold and occupied.

"For Amalfi, which is located on a four-hectare property within City di Mare, three buildings are ready for occupancy while eight out of the nine buildings of Sanremo are already constructed," Mercado said.

Retail stores are also set to open in Il Corso on the last quarter of the year.

Amalfi and Sanremo are part of the Phase 1 of the joint venture agreement between FLI and the City. (RVC)
