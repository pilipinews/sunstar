CITY HEIGHTENS DRIVE VS BUTANE CANISTER SELLERS

THE Local Government of Davao City intensified its operation against sellers of butane gas canisters in public markets and sari-sari stores.

Business Bureau chief Marissa Marasigan-Torentera said the city is in close coordination with the Department of Energy and the security forces in the intensive operations against those violating Executive Order No. 25, series of 2017.

The EO mandates the creation of a multi-agency task force to properly regulate and ensure safe practices by persons and entities handling and/or engaging in businesses involving flammable and dangerous chemicals and other hazardous and toxic substances.

Torentera said that Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio is closely monitoring the operation since it involves the safety of the people.

"We regularly conduct operations against those who continually sell refilled butane canisters. If we caught them selling one, we immediately give them a warning," she said. (PR)
