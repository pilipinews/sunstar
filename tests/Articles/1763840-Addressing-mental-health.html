ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH

AN ORDINANCE on the memorandum of agreement between the City Government of Davao and the Philippine Mental Health Association (PMHA)-Davao Chapter to address mental health issues was approved on third and final reading in the city council last September 11, 2018.

Ordinance 1154 provides the joint undertaking in the delivery of programs and services for women and children with mental health and psychological problems.

"They do a lot of advocacy work and hold lectures or seminars on mental health issues such as depression, suicide. The City allocated budget to support them," Davao City Councilor Mary Joselle Villafuerte said in a text message.

"The mayor supports all programs on mental health because this was also advocated by Nanay Soleng Duterte," she added.

Meanwhile, Precious S. Manliguez, executive manager of PMHA Davao chapter, said that PMHA through the MOA will continue their preventive approach in promoting mental health.

"We focus on giving lectures, seminars and workshops to enhance the capability of the participants in facing day to day stress and life's challenges," Manliguez said, adding that there is an increase in number of individuals who are willing to listen to PMHA lectures regarding mental health awareness, stress management and understanding depression in the past three years.

"For now the difference we observed is that our stakeholders know that there is an NGO who is willing to assist them in giving awareness and prevent mental disorders," she said.
