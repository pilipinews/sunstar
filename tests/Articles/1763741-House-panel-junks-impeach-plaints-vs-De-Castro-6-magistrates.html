HOUSE PANEL JUNKS IMPEACH PLAINTS VS DE CASTRO, 6 MAGISTRATES

THE consolidated impeachment complaint filed against Chief Justice Teresita Leonardo-De Castro and six other associate justices who ousted Maria Lourdes Sereno through a quo warranto petition was junked on Tuesday, September 11.

Twenty-three lawmakers from the House committee on justice voted against the motion of Siquijor Representative Ramon Rocamora to declare the impeachment complaints sufficient in form and substance.

The complaints were filed by Albay Representative Edcel Lagman, Ifugao Representative Teddy Baguilat and Magdalo Representative Gary Alejano.

Rocamora is the sole lawmaker who voted in the affirmative.

The complainants said the respondents -- De Castro, Associate Justices Diosdado Peralta, Lucas Bersamin, Francis Jardaleza, Noel Tijam, Andres Reyes Jr. and Alexander Gesmundo -- violated the Constitution after they decided the Sereno case despite "knowing fully well" that Sereno can only be ousted through impeachment.

De Castro, Peralta, Bersamin, Tijam and Jardeleza were also charged with betrayal of public trust for their failure to recuse from deciding the quo warranto amid their biases that complainants observed during the justice committee, which then heard the impeachment complaint filed against Sereno.

The decision of the justice panel was made after Angkla Party-list Representative Jesulito Manalo, Cavite Representative Strike Revilla, Ako-Bicol Party-list Representative Alfredo Garbin, Kabayan Party-list Representative Ron Salo, Sagip Party-list Representative Rodante Marcoleta, Coop-Natcco Party-list Representative Anthony Bravo and Leyte Representative Vicente Veloso manifested that the complaints should be dismissed for several reasons.

According to Manalo, the prejudice was insufficiently established in the complaints.

He said the justices' testimonies were made through a mandatory process and their decision as to whether or not they would testify was coursed through the Supreme Court en banc.

Manalo stressed that the facts presented by the complainants would not warrant a violation of the Constitution.

He also said he believes that the justices should not be removed for respecting the authority of the House of Representatives.

Veloso manifested the same, pointing out that it is due to the testimony of the respondent-magistrates that the House committee on justice was able to know that Sereno is not qualified to be a Chief Justice.

"They testified truthfully under subpoena. They should not be penalized for their coming to testify," Veloso said.

The panel chair, Representative Salvador Leachon scheduled another hearing on Tuesday, September 18, for the approval of its committee report. After the said committee action, the report will be transmitted to the plenary for approval.

Lagman asked the committee to allow the complainants to submit their motion for reconsideration.

His appeal, however, was denied. Leachon urged him to file a manifestation instead, as he is not a member of the committee.

Last week, the same committee, voting 21-0, declared that the impeachment complaints are sufficient in form. (SUNSTAR PHILIPPINES)
