DAVAO CITY BUYS 2 TOW TRUCKS

THE Davao City Transport and Traffic Management Office (CTTMO) has acquired two new tow trucks to strengthen its operations against illegally-parked vehicles all over the city.

"We have seen that we have bigger roads now in the city, which are unfortunately made into parking areas by some reckless motorists. We really need to strengthen our campaign against illegal parking and other road violations," Dionisio Abude, CTTMO chief, said.

He said the tow trucks can also be used for rescue operations in case of disasters and calamities.

At present, the city has a total of four towing vehicles for illegally-parked and abandoned vehicles.

From January to September 10 this year, the CTTMO has towed and impounded 758 various types of vehicles, including cars, motorcycles, tricycles, and "payong-payong."

"We are hoping for us to have more towing vehicles, those that are bigger so we can apprehend or even rescue bigger vehicles like trucks and buses," Abude said.

A total of P9.5 million was set aside for the purchase of the two new tow trucks, one of which was equipped with a boom, under the Local Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund of 2015. (PR)
