PAY OFF SRP LOAN NOW: PESQUERA

The Cebu City Council has urged Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osme√±a to include in the 2019 annual budget of the City Government the full payment of the loan it contracted for the South Road Property (SRP) project.

In a privileged speech, Councilor Jocelyn Pesquera said that instead of paying off the loan in 2025, it is better if the City prepays it the soonest possible time. Pesquera said the City can save a lot of money this way.

The loan amounting to 12.315 billion yen, which the City availed itself of from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica), started in 1995. That time, it was equivalent to P4.65 billion. It is payable within 30 years or until 2025.

The Land Bank of the Philippines serves as a conduit bank of Jica.

Pesquera said that after 22 years, records from the City Accounting Office as of Feb 20, 2018 would show that the City still has around P1.9 billion balance of the loan.

The City has already paid around P6 billion; P3.7 billion was paid for the principal while P2.8 billion was paid for the interest, among others.

In 2015, former mayor Michael Rama wanted to pay off the loan by using the proceeds of the sale of SRP lots but it did not push through. (RVC)
