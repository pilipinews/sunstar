PB CONDEMNS BRAZEN KILLING OF RONDA MAYOR

THE Cebu Provincial Board (PB) condemned the killing of Ronda Mayor Mariano Blanco III, saying that such act showed no respect for one's human rights.

During its session last Monday, the PB passed a resolution condemning the attack and another measure expressing sympathy to Blanco's family.

PB Member Christopher Baricuatro, in an approved resolution, said the killing created fear among Cebuanos and threatened the peace and order in the community.

He then pointed out that it is the mandate of the State to ensure that the public is safe and to protect the lives of its people.

Last Sept. 5, Blanco was shot dead by four unidentified men inside his office at the Ronda Municipal Hall. Blanco will be laid to rest on Sunday.
