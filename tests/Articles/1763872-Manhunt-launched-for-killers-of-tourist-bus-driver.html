MANHUNT LAUNCHED FOR 'KILLERS' OF TOURIST BUS DRIVER

PERSONNEL of the Mabolo Police Station in Cebu City are now conducting a manhunt operation against the three men on motorcycle who gunned down a bus driver in front of his family on 6th St., Barangay Apas last Monday afternoon.

Senior Police Officer 3 Jeffrey Larrobis, who is investigating the case, said that the three men, one of whom was the gunman, were behind the killing of Eliseo Devillieres, 34, a driver of Natalie tourist bus.

Devillieres hailed from Sitio Santo Ni√±o 2, Barangay Lower Casili in the town of Consolacion.

"We are still looking for them in their known addresses. The live-in partner (of Devillieres) identified one of the men and we are now conducting a hot pursuit operation against him," Larrobis said.

Larrobis said that the live-in partner of Devillieres told them that the latter received a death threat from his previous bus company based in Jagobiao, Mandaue City. "One of his colleagues in his previous bus company was seen lurking in the area prior to the attack," he said. (JOB)
