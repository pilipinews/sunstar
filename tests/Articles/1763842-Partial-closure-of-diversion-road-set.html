PARTIAL CLOSURE OF DIVERSION ROAD SET

THE Davao City Traffic and Transport Management Office will implement a temporary partial road closure along the diversion road, particularly in Laverna Hills, Buhangin, on September 21 to 25 and September 28 to October 2.

"The road closure is for the repair and maintenance of flood control and drainage by the Department Public Works and Highways 11 in the area," said DionisioAbude, Chief of CTTMO.

Abude said that only two lanes will be open in the Buhangin area, therefore, motorists are advised to avoid it on the said dates.

"On September 21 to 25, two lanes will be closed for repairs and on September 28 to October 2, the other two lanes will be repaired," Abude said.

He also laid alternate routes for Davao city motorists.

For those coming from Panacan going downtown, they are advised to take the Sasa road going to R. Castillo Street. Motorists from Buhangin could turn right to Angliongto going to J.P. Laurel, Bajada.

Meanwhile, drivers from Ulas could take McArthur Highway towards Quimpo Boulevard going straight to R. Castillo until Sasa.

The City Government called for the public's utmost patience during the implementation of the partial road closure. (PR)
