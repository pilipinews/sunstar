Mabolo Police Station Chief Inspector Dindo Juanito Alaras said the motive of the killing might be jealousy. The suspect claimed that the Korean had an affair with his girlfriend.

He said they could not yet determine if the foreigner was involved in illegal drug trade.

Last August 26, Lee was shot dead inside a motel on Holy Name St., Barangay Mabolo, Cebu City.

Casado was identified by a witness who saw him in the company of the Korean.

Investigators conducted a background check and found out that Casado has pending criminal cases in courts.

The operation was done with the operatives of Consolacion Police Station under Chief Inspector Gerard Ace Pelare, who said they coordinated with Alaras to serve two warrants of arrest for murders committed by Casado in the past. The warrants were issued by Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 28 Judge Alan Francisco Garciano and RTC Branch 56 Judge Ferdie Espiridion Riveral.

Pelare said Casado had been listed as a high-value target in Consolacion Police Station.

The suspect, he said, was elusive as he often transferred to different places to avoid detection and arrest.

Operatives seized from the suspect more than P300,000 worth of white crystalline substance believed to be methamphetamine hydrochloride, locally known as shabu.

A .45 pistol loaded with five bullets was also seized from Casado.

The suspect's companions were arrested. They are Ajie Capangpangan Soguilon, 18, and his mother, Arlene, 46.

Arlene is also Casada's live-in partner.(KAL)
