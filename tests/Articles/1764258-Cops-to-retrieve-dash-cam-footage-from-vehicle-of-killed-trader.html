COPS TO RETRIEVE DASH CAM FOOTAGE FROM VEHICLE OF KILLED TRADER

THE Mandaue City Police Office (MCPO) continues to scrutinize the footages they gathered relative to the death of a businessman on Hernan Cortes St. last Wednesday.

MCPO Director Julian Entoma said that the dash cam footage from the vehicle of victim Johnson Chiaoco, a paint shop owner, can possibly help identify the gunman.

Entoma admitted they are having a hard time identifying the suspect since he was wearing a full-face helmet during the attack.

"We will look into different angles from the dash cam of the vehicle that can hopefully help identify the suspect. We also submitted the victim's cellular phone for forensic examination. It might still contain the death threats the victim allegedly received last June," he said.

Entoma said they are considering as person of interest the previous business partner of Chiaoco.

"We are tracing the matter because someone who speaks Tagalog allegedly threatened him (Chiaoco) and we learned that his former business partner was from Manila. We are using it as a guide in our investigation," he said. (MARK JOVEN IGOT, USJ-R INTERN)
