SRP NORTH U-TURN SLOT TO BE CLOSED FOR REPAIR

MOTORISTS are reminded of the closure of the north u-turn slot at the South Road Properties to pave the way for repair and maintenance works.

Starting on Friday, motorists from the south will have to turn left at Vestil Rd. in going to the Mambaling area. The closure will be from 11 p.m. of Sept. 14 to 5 a.m. of Sept. 17.

Metal railings were earlier installed in the center of the Cebu South Coastal Road to prevent drivers from accessing the old u-turn slots, but they will be temporarily removed to allow a diversion route for northbound vehicles.

"We'll open the metal railings. This is a project, so we might as well expect heavy traffic. The DPWH (Department of Public Works and Highways) needs to fix something because there's a gap on the concrete road because of the number of big trucks that pass through there," said Francisco Ouano, operations head of the Cebu City Transportation Office.

Ouano said three traffic enforcers per eight-hour shift will man the traffic in the area. Signboards to guide motorists will also be installed in the surrounding area. (RTF)
