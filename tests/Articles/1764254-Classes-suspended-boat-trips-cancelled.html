CLASSES SUSPENDED, BOAT TRIPS CANCELLED

CLASSES from pre-school to high school in all public schools in the cities of Cebu, Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu are suspended today due to Typhoon Ompong, as the Philippine Coast Guard PCG barred all vessels from sailing beginning 5 p.m. yesterday to Saturday morning.

"Upon consideration of Pagasa's prediction and the assessment of the Cebu City Disaster Management Office regarding the effects of Typhoon Ompong, I hereby declare NO CLASSES in all schools under the Cebu City Government's jurisdiction tomorrow," Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osme√±a's Facebook post read.

City Hall personnel were deployed to the northern and mountain barangays to assess potential danger due to high winds, he said.

More than 30 areas in the country have been placed on Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal Number 1 as Typhoon Ompong (Mangkhut) continues to threaten northern Luzon while maintaining its strength yesterday afternoon.

As of 4 p.m. Thursday, the eye of Ompong was located at 575 kilometers east northeast of Virac, Catanduanes, packing maximum winds of 205 kilometers per hour (km/h) near the center and gusts of up to 255 km/h.

The typhoon was forecast to move west northwest at 25 km/h, said the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa).

Pagasa said Ompong is expected to make landfall in Cagayan-Isabela area early morning tomorrow.

For Visayas, however, the Pagasa Mactan station said it only issued a gale warning in Eastern Samar and Northern Leyte.

Lt. JG Michael John Encina, operations officer od PCG 7, said they decided to allow trips that are only short distance.

Among the trips allowed yesterday were those between Cebu and Bohol, Cebu and Ormoc City, Santander and Dumaguete City, Hagnaya in San Remigio and Bantayan Island, and Danao City and Camotes Island.

Encina said big vessels plying longer routes are cancelled. (LMY, HBL OF SUPERBALITA, EOB, SUNSTAR PHILIPPINES)
