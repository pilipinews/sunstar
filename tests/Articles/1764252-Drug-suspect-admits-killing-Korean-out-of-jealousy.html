DRUG SUSPECT ADMITS KILLING KOREAN OUT OF JEALOUSY

SUSPECTED big-time drug personality Jessie "Kano" Casado claimed that jealousy got the better of him and pushed him into killing a Korean national last month.

He said he saw his live-in partner Percy Abayon making love with Young Ho Lee inside a motel in Barangay Mabolo, Cebu City where he shot dead the foreigner last Aug. 26.

"Naay nakaisturya nako nga migo nako nga bantay-bantayi na imong asawa nimo kay nagbiga-biga na na (A friend told me to watch my wife because she was having an affair)," Casado told dyMF radio.

Acting on the information, Casado placed Abayon under surveillance. He later found her in the company of the foreigner.

Casado, 35, was caught in a hotel with his other girlfriend Ajie Capangpangan Soguilon, 18, and her mother Arlene, 46, last Wednesday night. Ajie is reportedly six months pregnant.

Abayon, a suspected drug personality, was caught in another operation.

She admitted that she had an affair with Lee and she was in the motel before the Korean was shot. Abayon told dyMF that she was not having sex with the victim when the incident happened, belying Casado's claim.

Young Hun Oh, Second Secretary and Consul of Korea in Cebu, praised the local police for Casado's arrest and Lee's murder and said the incident cannot affect tourism.

"I hope this kind of a crime, such as murder, will not happen again in the Philippines," Oh told reporters yesterday.

The official said Cebu is still a "fantastic place for traveling and very safe." He said more Korean tourists and investors will come and do good in Cebu.

Cebu City Police Office Director Royina Garma said illegal drugs, drug paraphernalia and two pistols were recovered from the suspects.

She said the firearms will be subjected to a ballistic examination to determine if these were used in previous murders.

Mabolo Police Station Chief Dindo Alaras said Casado admitted using one of the .45 pistols as the murder weapon he used in killing Lee. Alaras and his men received an incentive of P5,000 from Garma for Casado's arrest.

Investigators conducted a background check on Casado and they found out that he has pending criminal cases in courts. KAL
