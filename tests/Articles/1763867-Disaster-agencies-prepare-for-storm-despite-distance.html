DISASTER AGENCIES PREPARE FOR STORM DESPITE DISTANCE

ALTHOUGH it will not directly hit the Visayas, the Cebu City Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office (CCDRRMO) has alerted the barangays as Typhoon Mangkhut (international name) enters the Philippine Area of Responsibility today.

CCDRRMO Chief Nagiel Bañacia said they already received an advisory that the public should be alerted of the typhoon, which will be named Ompong once it enters the country.

"It is expected to bring rains and the secondary effect of that will be flooding and landslides," he said.

Bañacia said they already activated Operation Listo to avoid any casualty and damage to property due to the bad weather.

He said barangays will serve as first responders in case of untoward incidents. 

Banacia said that starting yesterday residents were requested to prepare and continue to be vigilant.

He said they also asked the Department of Public Services to double its efforts in garbage collection and disposal.

The public was also reminded to dispose their garbage properly to prevent clogging of drainage systems in the city.

Meantime, the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (PDRRMO) also assured the public that it is also preparing for Mangkhut even if it is expected to hit mostly the northern part of the country.

"Di lang ta mokumpiyansa kay base pud nila, modala pud siyag hangin ug ulan (Let's be cautious still because it brings wind and rain as well)," said PDRRMO Head Baltazar Tribunalo Jr.

He said the public should be watchful, especially those in landslide-prone areas.

He said that even a tree in a flat area may fall due to unstable weather.

"Take note, it happened in Sibonga," said Tribunalo.

Another thing to be watchful for is that the typhoon might reach Cebu.

"Motuyok man na siya, higupon man na sa unsang klase sa hangin nga posibleng moari gyud satoa ang typhoon, ato man sad nang gipangandaman (It might make a turn, the wind may pull it towards us. We're also preparing for that)," said Tribunalo.

Tribunalo said the areas in Cebu that are prone to landslides and flooding are Malabuyoc, Sibonga and Argao. In Central Cebu, there is San Fernando and a portion in Carcar especially in the poblacion.

He said that Mananga River in Talisay is also prone to flash flooding as well as Carmen and Danao. There are also some areas in Pinamungajan, Toledo City up until Tuburan, which are prone to landslide.

Tribunalo said there are rivers in some barangays in Balamban and Asturias, such as Buanoy, Arpili and Sta. Rita, which might be dangerous once the typhoon enters Cebu.

"Mao nay atong mga bantayanan kaayo nga mga sapa, kung baha ang mahisgutan (Those are the rivers to monitor, if we talk about flooding)," said Tribunalo.

In terms of the equipment, the PDRRMO has coordinated with the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH).

Tribulano said the heavy equipment that local responders will use in case of emergency is already on standby. DPWH will also help them in case a heavy landslide occurs. (RVC, MARY RUTH MALINAO, USJR INTERN)
