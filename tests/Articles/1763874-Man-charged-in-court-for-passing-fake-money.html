MAN CHARGED IN COURT FOR PASSING FAKE MONEY

THE Office of the Cebu City Prosecutor has indicted the alleged leader of a group responsible for the proliferation of fake money in Barangay Pahina San Nicolas. The prosecutors found evidence to charge Miguelito Albiso with violation of Article 168 of the Revised Penal Code, or illegal possession and use of false treasury or bank notes. Albiso was arrested after he allegedly sold counterfeit bills to a representative of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) last Aug. 17, 2018. Operatives from the BSP and the Cebu City Police Station 6 in Barangay Pahina San Nicolas nabbed Albiso in an entrapment. The arrest came after a BSP agent received reports about the proliferation of counterfeit peso bills being perpetrated by Albiso and his accomplices in the village. The BSP then coordinated with the police and carried out a buy-bust against Albiso. Authorities seized from Albiso 19 pieces of fake P1,000; 24 pieces of P500; five pieces of P100; and a P200 bill, totaling P31,700. (GMD)
