PROGRAM LOWERS DEMAND FOR ILLEGAL DRUGS

A PRIVATELY-LED program claimed that they helped reduce the demand for illegal drugs in Davao City.

"Naka-reduce tayo ng P6 million worth of drugs through this program," Doctor Corazon Umblero, head of the "UIC Kaduyog sa Kinabuhi" program, said in a press conference at The Royal Mandaya Hotel on Wednesday, September 12, 2018.

She said the program is their response to the call of the Church to fight illegal drugs and also their immediate action on the challenge of the government on issues related to drugs.

The data showed by Umblero indicates a 9.87 percent of drug test cost saved from the 4,581 total number of drug screening conducted from March 2017 to June 2018.

Total amount of drugs "saved" with 4,556 test kits is P2.3 million, while the amount spent for drug kits is P229,050.

"Kadtong naay mga nag-surrender na mga persons with substantial disorder, pwede mo mag-apil sa among program sa University of the Immaculate Conception- main campus (Those who surrendered, persons with substantial disorder, you may join our program in the University of the Immaculate Conception-main campus)," Umblero said.

"Unya mu-undergo ta ug unom ka bulan na intensive treatment (They will then undergo a six-month intensive treatment)," she added.
