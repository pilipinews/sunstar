WOMAN CAUGHT WITH DRUGS INSIDE MOTEL

A 43-YEAR-OLD woman was caught in a drug bust at 9 p.m. Tuesday, September 11, inside a motel in Barangay Lawaan, Talisay City, Cebu.

The suspect, Rowena Cabalda, yielded 28 grams of white crystalline substance believed to be methamphetamine hydrochloride, locally known as shabu.

The contraband worth P322,000, a Dangerous Drugs Board value, was seized by the operatives of Provincial Drug Enforcement Unit (PDEU), Provincial Intelligence Branch, Talisay City Police Station and Regional Mobile Force Company.

The operatives also seized a drug repacking paraphernalia from the suspect.

Senior Inspector Alejandro Batobalonos, PDEU chief, said Cabalda is from Sitio Rattan, Barangay Tanke, a drug-infested village in Talisay City.

Cabalda's husband is an inmate of Talisay City Jail and he is facing drug charges in court.

Batobalonos said the suspect admitted that her supplier came from Cebu City.

Cabalda will be facing a complaint for violating Republic Act 9165, or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. Selling shabu is a non-bailable offense. (KAL)
