DUTERTE ACCEPTS NFA CHIEF'S RESIGNATION

PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday, September 11, revealed that he will be scouting for a new executive who can head the National Food Authority (NFA) because administrator Jason Aquino has asked to be relieved from his post.

In a têtê-a-têtê with Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo, Duterte said Aquino has decided to give up the position at the grains agency, as the NFA chief was already "tired."

"Jason Aquino has requested that he be relieved already. He has said that he's tired and he cannot cope up with the laro diyan sa (politics) inside, which is always ordinary, happening in government because we cannot be in agreement all the time," the President said.

"I will scout for a new one," he added.

Aquino's resignation came amid the continuing rice distribution problems persisting in the country.

Meantime, Duterte cautioned that he would go after private traders who would hoard rice amid the raging rice crisis.

"'Yung iba kino-control (Some are controlling the rice prices). They are back into it again -- the bad practice of manipulation to make money at the expense of your countrymen. Iyan ang ayaw ko (That's what I don't like)," he said. (SUNSTAR PHILIPPINES)
