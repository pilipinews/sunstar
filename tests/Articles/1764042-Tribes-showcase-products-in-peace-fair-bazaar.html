TRIBES SHOWCASE PRODUCTS IN PEACE FAIR BAZAAR

DIFFERENT tribes of Davao City participate in the three-day Multi-cultural Peace Fair Bazaar that closes today, September 13, 2018, at the Abreeza Mall showcasing their various cultural products and promoting peace.

"This is part of our mission to promote activities which will foster and encourage sustainable peace kasi yun ang gusto namin," Vince Molejon, secretary general of the Mindanao Peace Council, said during the Armed Forces of the Philippines-Philippine National Police Press Corps Southern Mindanao press conference at The Royal Mandaya Hotel Wednesday.

"Yun din ang task ng Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (Opapp) as a civil society partner of the government," Molejon added.

A total of 40 exhibitors from the city and outside the city participate in the event that opened Tuesday, September 11, and 15 of these are from the indigenous peoples (IPs).

He added that the prices of the tribal products are just fair because of the effort exerted on it.

"It is a novelty product; tayo lang ang mayroong ganyan. So, kung sabihin nating mahal, siguro dapat i-recognize natin ang effort niyan," Molejon said.

"Ang akin lang dito is we are promoting the novelty products of the Muslims and Lumads, tingnan natin ang effort nila, ang proseso sa paggawa nyan," he added.

The National Commission on Muslim Filipinos said it is supporting the activity and encouraging Dabawenyos to visit the bazaar.

The Multi-cultural Peace Fair Bazaar is part of the celebration of the National Peace Consciousness Month which started with a fun run called "Dagan para sa Kalinaw" last September 2. (LHC)
