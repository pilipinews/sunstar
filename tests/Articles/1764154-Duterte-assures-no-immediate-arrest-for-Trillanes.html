DUTERTE ASSURES NO IMMEDIATE ARREST FOR TRILLANES

PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday, September 13, assured his fierce critic Senator Antonio Trillanes IV that he would not be arrested without a warrant of arrest issued by the court.

Duterte, in a chance interview in Quezon City, guaranteed that he did not give any directive to the military or police to arrest Trillanes, who remains holed up in his Senate office to evade possible arrest following the revocation of his amnesty.

"Nobody is interested to arrest (him). The military does not have the interest. I do not have the interest. He can stay there (in his office at the Senate) as a boarder. The police, sabi ko (I told them), do not arrest until there is a warrant of arrest by the court," the President said.

Duterte made the remark after Makati City Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 148, which heard Trillanes's coup d'etat case, postponed earlier Thursday its ruling on the Department of Justice's (DOJ) petition for an alias warrant of arrest and hold departure order against the senator.

The Makati court decided to give Trillanes 10 days to file a comment on the petition against him.

The DOJ also sought a warrant against Trillanes from the Makati City RTC Branch 150 that heard the rebellion case against him.

On August 31, Duterte signed Proclamation 572, declaring Trillanes's amnesty void from the very beginning because of supposed failure to submit an official amnesty application form and admit guilt over his involvement in the Oakwood Mutiny in 2003 and the Manila Peninsula Siege in 2007.

Both uprisings were staged against former President and now House Speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.

Duterte maintained that he would await the decision of the Makati courts.

"Wala namang order. So kung walang order, huwag niyong pakialaman (There is no order yet. If there is no order, do not make any actions yet)," he said. (SUNSTAR PHILIPPINES)
