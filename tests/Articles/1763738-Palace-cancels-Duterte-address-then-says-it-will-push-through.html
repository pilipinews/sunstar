PALACE CANCELS DUTERTE ADDRESS, THEN SAYS IT WILL PUSH THROUGH

(UPDATED) - Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque Jr. clarified that President Rodrigo Duterte's scheduled address to the nation will push through as scheduled at 3 p.m. on Tuesday, September 11, but under a modified format.

Roque said the President's press conference with Palace reporters was cancelled, but the President will still address the nation through a têtê-a-têtê with Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo.

Roque said Panelo will ask the questions submitted by members of the media earlier.

Roque issued the clarification after an advisory sent to Palace reporters on Tuesday afternoon announced that Duterte would no longer hold a press conference initially set at 3.p.m

"Hi all, I would like to relay that [Duterte's] press conference today is no longer included in today's activities. Thank you," the media advisory read.

On Monday, September 10, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque Jr. announced that Duterte would "talk to the people" on Tuesday. (RUTH ABBEY GITA/SUNSTAR PHILIPPINES)
