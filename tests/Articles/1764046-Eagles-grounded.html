EAGLES GROUNDED

THE 301-member Davao City delegation was set to leave in three batches today but Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio Wednesday, September 12, cancelled the trip for the 2018 Batang Pinoy National Championships in Baguio City due to the looming typhoon.

In a statement issued yesterday, the mayor said, "It is with a heavy heart that we cancel the trip," as she based her decision on current reports of AccuWeather and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) that Typhoon Mangkhut is expected to enter the Philippines Wednesday, September 12, and will threaten Northern Luzon.

She cited her concerns on flooding, rainfall, damaging winds, coastal flooding, and travel disruptions. She also said that if heavy rains continue for several hours, landslides will be a great possibility.

"This is to ensure that the delegates will not be caught stranded in bad weather. We cannot compromise the safety of the children, coaches, and support staff," Duterte-Carpio said, adding that "athletes and coaches who will pursue their travel to attend the games shall do so at their own risk."

SAFETY FIRST

Mikey Aportadera, Sports Development Division of the City Mayor's Office (SDD-CMO) officer-in-charge, said he talked with the mayor Wednesday dawn.

He said the mayor decided to withdraw the city's entry "for the safety of everybody regardless if we get there safely".

Aportadera said they could not take risks and would monitor the effects of the typhoon during the weekend.

"We don't want parents also to worry about their children," he said, adding that they already informed all coaches for them to disseminate the information to their athletes.

He felt for the athletes, saying in the vernacular, "I feel bad I know their excitement to compete. We are all ready. We are about to leave tomorrow. But act of God and act of nature is beyond our control. Don't worry there will be more events in the future."

NO OPENING

Due to safety concerns of participants, the Philippine Sports Commission and the City Government of Baguio Wednesday issued a joint statement that they will push through with the holding of the Batang Pinoy nationals but they will forego the holding of the opening ceremonies scheduled on Saturday, September 15.

The games will then get going on Monday, September 17.

Baguio City Mayor lawyer Mauricio Domogan, in the statement, promised a "grand closing celebration."

PSC Chairman William Ramirez, who gathered the PSC Crisis Management Team, supported Domogan's decision and instructed his staff to accommodate all delegations who need a "safe house" while in Manila.

He also said that he understood the concern of some delegations who are pulling out due to the storm. He added that they will study and schedule major sports events in the country not to be held during the rainy season.

In a phone interview, Ramirez said, "We respect the decision of LGUs (who are withdrawing from the games)."

Seven delegations are already in the City of Pines as of Wednesday.

A total of 7,000 delegates of athletes, coaches and officials are expected but actual turnout may be reduced due to the storm.
