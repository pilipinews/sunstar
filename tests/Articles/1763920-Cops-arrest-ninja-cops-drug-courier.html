COPS ARREST NINJA COPS' DRUG COURIER

POLICE arrested in a drug bust Tuesday, September 11, a woman who allegedly served as drug courier of "ninja cops," National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) Director Guillermo Eleazar said.

Amelita Sabino, 49, was nabbed in a drug bust conducted by the NCRPO Regional Drug Enforcement Unit (RDEU) around 6:30 p.m. on Palawan St. corner Visayan Street in Sampaloc, Manila. Over P4 million worth of illegal drugs was seized from her.

Eleazar said Sabino sold at least 600 grams of suspected methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) to an undercover agent, and another 50 grams of illegal drugs were seized from her after the arrest.

The drugs -- a total of 650 grams of shabu -- have a street value of over P4.4 million, said Eleazar.

He said Sabino was identified as a drug pusher and courier being utilized by Police Officer 2 Yolly Lapuz Aliangan, an arrested "ninja cop."

Aliangan was nabbed by the National Bureau of Investigation on May 26, 2016 for violation of Republic Act 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.

Recovered from Aliangan were six vehicles, several firearms, cash amounting to P6,911,000 and several kilos of shabu.

Aliangan is currently detained at the Manila City Jail but is reportedly still engaged in drug trafficking activities operating in Metro Manila and Calabarzon areas, said Eleazar. (SUNSTAR PHILIPPINES)
