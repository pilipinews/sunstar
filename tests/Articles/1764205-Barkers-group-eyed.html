BARKERS' GROUP EYED

DAVAO City Transport and Traffic Management Office (CTTMO) head Dionisio Abude said he might suggest organizing barkers or dispatchers to become "street attendants" instead.

During the i-Speak forum at the City Hall Thursday, September 13, Abude said he planned on tapping the street barkers in reminding drivers about the 20-second rule on yellow boxes.

He said he convened all the dispatchers in Davao City that were on his list and asked them what their contributions are for being on the streets because he has been receiving complaints from students, parents and drivers.

"Ang complaint sa mga ginikanan, ang mga estudyante inyong gina-tsansingan, hubog pa gyud kaayo, masuko pa jud sa driver kung muhawa na nga dili mapuno. Tama ba na ang ginahimo sa mga barkers? (Parents complained that barkers are taking advantage of the students, going there drunk, and getting angry at drivers. Are those things they are doing right?)," Abude said.

Instead of contributing to the development of the city, barkers are only adding more problems, thus, Abude said he wishes for the city government of Davao to consider his plans.

Abude added that by doing so will give them the chance to have proper job.

The CTTMO does not have the authority to stop the dispatchers, but the public may file a case against them if they do something illegal.

"Depende na sa driver kay kung masuko sila na dili muhatag, that is extortion. Kanang act of lasciviousness sa mga estudyante, pwede na mu-file og kaso (If they get angry at drivers if they are not given (money) then that is extortion. For students, they could file a case for acts of lasciviousness)," Abude said.
