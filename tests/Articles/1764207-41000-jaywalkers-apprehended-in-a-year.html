41,000 JAYWALKERS APPREHENDED IN A YEAR

THE Davao City Transport and Traffic Management Office (CTTMO) has apprehended a total of 40,817 jaywalkers from September 11, 2017 to end-August 2018.

Of the total, 13,788 did not settle their cases, CTTMO head Dionisio Abude said during the I-speak forum at the City Hall Thursday, September 13.

He said they have not imposed the penalty of four-hour community service yet.

"Ang mahitabo, gihatagan gihapon nato sila ug lugway na seven days, at the time sa apprehension, kung wala pa siyay ikabayad na P100 penalty, naa pa siyay time na ma-settle niya (What happened was we gave them [violators] the chance to settle within seven days after the apprehension. In case they cannot pay the P100 penalty, they still have time to settle)," Abude said.

It was reported that from the time of the implementation, the number of jaywalkers in Davao City has been decreasing every month.

Abude attributed the decrease to the lack of personnel assigned on the streets to apprehend jaywalkers.

There were a total of 6,354 apprehended jaywalkers in September 2017, while only 660 in July and 490 in August of this year.

"As far as I am concerned, dili pud ko makasulti na mao ni sya ang resulta sa disiplina sa mga tao na dili na mutabok bisag asa (As far as I am concerned, I cannot totally say that the decrease was the result of the public being disciplined on where to cross the street)," Abude said.

"Ang ubang personnel kay gi-pull out namo para mag-implement sa 20-second rule sa yellow boxes (Other CTTMO personnel were pulled out to implement the 20-second rule on yellow boxes)," he added.
