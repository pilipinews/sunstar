TYPHOON MANGKHUT TO ENTER PAR WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON

TYPHOON Mangkhut has intensified further and was expected to enter the Philippine area of responsibility (PAR) Wednesday afternoon, September 12, said the state weather bureau.

As of 8 a.m. Wednesday, Mangkhut was located at 1,190 kilometers east northeast of Guiuan, Eastern Samar, packing maximum winds of 205 kilometers per hour (km/h) near the center and gusts of up to 255 km/h.

It is moving west at 20 km/h, said the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa).

The typhoon is expected to be 805 kilometers east of Virac, Catanduanes, by Thursday morning, September 13. By Friday, it will be located at 605 kilometers east of Baler, Aurora, said Pagasa.

Pagasa weather forecaster Chris Perez said Mangkhut might become a super typhoon if it continues to intensify while moving closer to the country.

Pagasa said Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal Number 1 may be raised over eastern Luzon as early as Wednesday night to early morning Thursday, September 13.

"The typhoon may traverse the Cagayan-Batanes area around Saturday (September 15). Heavy rains and strong winds possible over northern Luzon and parts of Central and Southern Luzon. Surrounding seas will be rough to very rough," said Pagasa.

Mangkhut may also enhance the southwest monsoon or "habagat," which will bring occasional rains over Palawan, Mindoro Provinces and Western Visayas by Friday and Saturday, added Pagasa. (LMY/SUNSTAR PHILIPPINES)
