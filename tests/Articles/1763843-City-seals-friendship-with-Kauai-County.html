CITY SEALS FRIENDSHIP WITH KAUAI COUNTY

DAVAO City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio on Monday, September 10, visited Kauai County in Hawaii to sign a Friendship Certificate and show her commitment to the partnership.

"This visit is an affirmation of the City Government of Davao of our mutual cooperation on matters of tourism and culture, agriculture, and trade and commerce," Mayor Duterte-Carpio said in her address.

The mayor also underscored the deepening sisterhood relationship with Kauai because of shared similarities "that transcends boundaries, diversity of population and stand on development vis-Ã -vis the preservation of the gifts of nature."

Kauai Mayor Bernard Carvalho, Jr., meanwhile, declared that Davao City and Kauai's sisterhood agreement is strong and powerful with common denominators on sense of family, dedication to build the youth and connection to (respective) culture and heritage, and dedication to agriculture, tourism and other business and economic ventures.

Mayor Carvalho came to Davao City in early 2017 to establish a sister-city relationship.

A year later, Carvalho returned and signed the agreement with the lady mayor with an invitation for her to reciprocate the visit to Kauai, Hawaii.

According to US Census, Hawaii has an estimated 1.4 million 2018 population. It has eight major islands and Kauai ranks fourth in terms of population.

In an earlier census, Filipinos and Hawaiians of Filipino descent are found to be the second largest racial group in Hawaii. (PR)
