DILAPIDATED VEHICLES CAN'T BE REGISTERED: LTO

THE Land Transportation Office (LTO) 7 yesterday clarified that no dilapidated vehicles will be registered as it will endanger life and property.

LTO 7 Director Victor Emmanuel Caindec said that his agency checks vehicle road-worthiness upon inspection prior to registration.

In the course of 12 months, that responsibility rests with the owner, and in cases of random road inspection.

He said that it is beyond irrational to demand 100 percent inspection of all vehicles in the road all the time and no government does that anywhere in the world.

"That's why operations are done at random. However, if citizens find any violators, they are encouraged to report so we can take appropriate action," Caindec said.

He explained that dilapidated vehicles are those that have heavily damaged bodies and engines, while vehicles which are not worthy to be allowed to run are those that lack brakes, clutch or light.

Meanwhile, Caindec said they solved the threat of the tourist transport sector in Bohol to go on strike due to heightened operations by LTO 7 against colorum vans in Bohol as directed by President Rodrigo Duterte.

Caindec said that with the Boracay shutdown, tourism in Bohol increased as alternative for foreign and local tourists. (EOB)
