CITY'S TRAFFIC LIGHT SYSTEM DEFECTIVE

EIGHT investors have expressed interest in improving Cebu City's traffic light system.

Councilor Jerry Guardo, chairman of the council committee on transportation, said the 30-year-old Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System (SCATS) used by the City is now defective and needs replacement.

The investors are from Australia, Austria and Taiwan. One investor is a local firm.

Guardo, who is tasked by Mayor Tomas Osmeña to look for a solution to the city's traffic light problem, said that the traffic light systems of eight of the 80 intersections in the city are no longer working,

It is in these eight intersections where the city's traffic problem usually starts, especially when there are no traffic enforcers, Guardo said.

Guardo also said that of the 658 detectors in the city's streets, only 118 are working.

A detector determines the volume of vehicles in an intersection and automatically adjusts the time for traffic lights to change.

Guardo said Osmeña wants a public-private partnership for the traffic light system project. (PAC)
